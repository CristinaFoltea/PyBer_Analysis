Analysis of the ride and driver fare per city types

## Challenge

1. The summary table combines the total number of rides, driver, fare and the average fare per ride and driver for each city category. Based on the data, we can conclude that the urban areas use the service the most, having the most rides and drivers. As a result of high availability, the ride fare is cheaper and driver revenue is lowest. On the lower end we have rural cities, with the lowest amount of rides and drivers; a more expensive average ride with a higher income for the drivers.
