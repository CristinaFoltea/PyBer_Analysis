Based on the data we can conclude that the urban areas uses the service the most, having most of the rides and drivers. As a result of hight availability the ride fare is cheaper with driver gaining the least. On the oposite spectrum are the rural area. A lot number of rides and driver lead to more expensive rides and with driver having a higher income.
